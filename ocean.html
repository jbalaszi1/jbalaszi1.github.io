  The Ocean Pollution Infographic was created to inform maybe even shock people about the garbage patches that are in the ocean. I used orange and blue because they are opposite on the color wheel giving the infographic an eye catching effect. I chose the font that I used because I wanted something direct and impersonal. I wanted it to look like here are the harsh facts.

    I chose to do an infographic on ocean pollution because I firmly believe this is something we should fix. We are entirely to blame for this problem, so we need to fix it. It needed attention drawn to it.
