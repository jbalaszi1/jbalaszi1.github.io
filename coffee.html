    For the Koexist Koffee logo I decided to use a frog because it promotes a certain peace. I used green and grey to make it neutral and accepting. I used the font for the koexist koffee name because it feels flowy, friendly, and interesting. The other font I used was just to make it not take away from the other font and the logo.

  Koexist Koffee is a place of acceptence built on people who come from all different backgrounds. They named the coffee shop after the idea of everyone being accepted. Its very relaxed and just a cool place to get coffee. I chose to do their logo because I wanted to do something for a local up and coming buisness.
