   Bitter Sweet was designed to really have an elegant look. The purple and silver colors on the wine bottle label are to give it that expensive feeling. The grapes and the grape vine resembles a chandelier. The wood engraved box is the definition of elegant. The satin lining and engraved design gives it that extra finished look.

    I chose to do branding for wine because I am a wine connoisseur. I enjoy the complex flavors, and time and dedication it takes to make a good wine. I wanted to show those factors in the presentation of wine.
