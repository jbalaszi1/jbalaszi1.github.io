    <p class="ap">I am the person I am suppose to become. Being a graphic designer allows me to make things. Making things is all I want to do with my life. To create and be creative in something as important as marketing and design fulfills a purpose in my life. I live breath and sleep design. Its all around us and being able to recongnize and understand it makes me feel like apart of something bigger.</p>  

<p class="ap">Growing up I didn't always want to be a visual commuication designer. When I was young I wanted to search the outer limits of the universe as an astronuat, or discover the unknown depths of the deep ocean as an oceanographer. I was always looking for a something bigger, something greater then myself. Finding something that I love to do was the answer to everything that I was looking for.</p>


<p class="ap">The way I got in to visual communication design is probably different then most people. It was merley suggested to me to try it. I was 18 at the time and working on my AA degree. I finished my AA degree and transfered to Eastern Washington University to get my Bacholers degree in Visual Communication Design. This June I will have my degree and be ready for the next step.  I have been in school devoted to being a visual communication designer for 6 years.  </p>


<p class="ap">I am 24 years old and live in Spokane, WA. I have built my life on things that I love. Being surrounded by the things that I love has made my life so fulfilling. Visual communication design might apart of what makes my life fulfilling but its so important to me that I found it. I am the person I am suppose to become. </p>
