    <p class="ap">Hello, I am Johanna and I am a graphic designer. I started off at North Idaho college earning my AA degree in general studies. From there I went to Eastern Washington University, where I spent three years going to school full time and working full time until June 2016 when I received my bachelors degree in Visual Communication Design. Before I graduated I was given the opportunity to expand my knowledge at the Spokane Journal of Business. At the Journal I have learned copious amounts of new information along with given the time and opportunity to expand my education through tutorials and new experiences. 
    
<p class="ap">I love the graphic design field. Being able to create everyday is something I want to do for the rest of my life. I am currently attending the University of Denver working on achieving my Masters degree in web design and development. I enjoy other creative outlets such as photography and videography.</p>
