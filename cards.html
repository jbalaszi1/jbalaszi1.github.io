   Art Nouveau is centered around this fluid organic idea. I really wanted to hone in on that when I created the Art Nouveau deck of cards. I chose more organic colors (green and blue), and every shape even if it is originally a hard shape, like a diamond or spade, I made sure I gave it a fluid idea.

    I chose to do an Art Nouveau themed deck of cards because it was a broad theme that I could really be creative with. I enjoy new challenges when it comes to design and I really enjoyed making this deck of cards.
